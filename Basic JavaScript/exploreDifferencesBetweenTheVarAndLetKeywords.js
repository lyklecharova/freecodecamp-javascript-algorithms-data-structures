/*
    A keyword called let was introduced in ES6, 
    a major update to JavaScript, to solve this potential issue with the var keyword. 
    You'll learn about other ES6 features in later challenges.

//Update the code so it only uses the let keyword.
/*
    var catName = "Oliver";
    var catSound = "Meow!";
*/
let catName = "Oliver";
let catSound = "Meow!";

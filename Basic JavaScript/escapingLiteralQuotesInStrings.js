/*
    In JavaScript, you can escape a quote from considering 
    it as an end of string quote by placing a backslash (\) 
    in front of the quote.

/*
    Use backslashes to assign a string to the myStr variable so that
    if you were to print it to the console, you would see:
 */


const myStr = "I am a \"double quoted\" string inside \"double quotes\".";
